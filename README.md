## Tools and Technologies

1. **Django**:

   - Django is used as the backend framework for handling database operations, user authentication, and business logic.
   - The project makes extensive use of Django’s built-in apps, such as `django.contrib.auth` for user management and `django.contrib.admin` for the admin interface.
   - Middleware such as `SecurityMiddleware`, `SessionMiddleware`, and custom middleware like `UserSettingsMiddleware` are used to handle requests and manage user sessions securely.
   - Template rendering is done through Django's template engine, with templates stored in the `templates` directory.

2. **Bootstrap**:

   - Bootstrap was using for pages style .

3. **SQLite (Development) / PostgreSQL (Production)**:

   - **SQLite** is used as the default local database for development, configured through Django’s ORM.
   - In production, **PostgreSQL** is used to handle more complex queries and larger datasets. The database configuration is managed using `dj_database_url`, which pulls the database URL from environment variables.
   - Example:
     ```python
     DATABASES = {
         "default": dj_database_url.config(default=os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
     }
     ```

   [Back to top](#top)

4. **Heroku**:

   - The application is deployed on **Heroku**, which handles the hosting and scaling of the application.
   - Heroku’s environment is configured with Django’s settings, including support for static files via `WhiteNoise` and media file storage via Cloudinary.
   - Specific settings for static and media files are determined based on the environment (`DEBUG` mode):
     ```python
     if DEBUG:
         STATICFILES_STORAGE = "whitenoise.storage.CompressedStaticFilesStorage"
     else:
         STATICFILES_STORAGE = "whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage"
     ```

5. **Cloudinary**:

   - **Cloudinary** is used for storing and serving media files (such as user-uploaded images).
   - It allows the application to store media externally in a cloud service, freeing up local storage and ensuring quick access to images.
   - The connection to Cloudinary is configured via the `CLOUDINARY_URL` environment variable:
     ```python
     DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = "cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage"
     ```
   - Additionally, `django-resized` is used for optimizing and resizing images before they are stored.

6. **Django Channels**:

   - **Django Channels** is used to enable real-time communication in the application, supporting WebSockets and asynchronous tasks. This is essential for handling live updates and interactions, particularly with smart home devices like lights and sensors( planing in feature).
   - The current implementation allows for basic real-time status updates of vars states.

   - **Planned Future Features**:

     - There are several advanced features planned for future implementation using Django Channels, including:
       - **Live Device Monitoring**: Users will be able to monitor the status of multiple smart devices in real-time, such as receiving updates from sensors or checking the live status of connected devices.
       - **Instant Notifications**: The system will be capable of sending real-time notifications and alerts when specific events occur, such as security breaches, motion detection, or temperature changes.
       - **Two-Way Communication**: The app will enable two-way communication with devices, allowing for real-time feedback and control. For example, lights can send back their status after a command is issued, ensuring synchronization between the user interface and device state.

   - **Current Setup**:

     - Django Channels is currently configured with an in-memory backend for handling real-time communication:
       ```python
       ASGI_APPLICATION = "home_control_project.asgi.application"
       CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
           "default": {
               "BACKEND": "channels.layers.InMemoryChannelLayer",
           },
       }
       ```
     - As the project scales and the need for more complex real-time features grows, there are plans to migrate to a more robust backend (e.g., Redis) to handle higher traffic volumes and more simultaneous connections.

     ```

     ```

7. **Django Extensions**:

   - The project uses `django-extensions` for various development utilities, such as enhanced model management, shell utilities, and custom scripts.

8. **Firmware Updates with Progress Feedback**

- This feature allows users to initiate remote firmware updates for the ESP32 device and monitor the progress in real-time through the web interface.

- **Upload Firmware**: The user can upload a firmware file through the Django web interface.
- **Remote Firmware Update**: Once uploaded, the firmware is transferred from the Django server to the ESP32 for the update process.
- **Real-time Progress Feedback**: Users can view live status updates of the firmware upload and installation process, ensuring transparency and tracking for the operation.
- **Error Handling**: In case of any issues during the upload or installation process, the user will receive appropriate error messages.

## Legal Disclaimer & Security Considerations

### Disclaimer

This project, **Smart Home Control**, is intended solely for **educational purposes**, created by a student as part of a learning experience. The author of this project assumes **no liability or responsibility** for any damage, harm, or unintended consequences that may arise from the use, modification, or deployment of this software.More  **significant improvements and refinements** are required for it to become a fully functioning home control ecosystem. Users who choose to implement this software or integrate it into their systems do so **at their own risk**.

- This project is provided "as-is" without any warranties, guarantees, or assurances regarding its safety, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose.
- Any damage caused by improper use, setup, or integration into third-party devices or networks is **solely the responsibility** of the user.
- **Port forwarding** or other networking configurations may expose your devices to external threats. It is your responsibility to ensure that your home network and devices are secure.

### Additional Security Considerations

1. **Port Forwarding**: If you plan to access your home automation system remotely, you may consider using port forwarding to allow external access to your server or devices. However, doing so can introduce serious security risks, such as unauthorized access to your home network.

   - **Use VPN**: For enhanced security, consider setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to remotely access your home network securely rather than exposing your devices through port forwarding.
   - **Firewall Configuration**: Ensure your firewall is properly configured to block any unwanted traffic and to allow only necessary connections to your devices.

2. **Strong Passwords**: Ensure that all passwords, including those for the Django admin interface, your Wi-Fi network, and any API or device credentials, are strong and secure. Use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

3. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: It is strongly recommended that you use SSL/TLS encryption for all communication between the server (Django) and the devices (ESP32), especially if you plan to expose the system to the internet. This can help protect against Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

   - Set up SSL certificates for your server.
   - Use https for web traffic and secure protocols for any device communications.

4. **Regular Updates**: Ensure that you keep the server, devices (ESP32), and libraries up-to-date with the latest security patches and firmware updates.

   - Check regularly for updates to the project’s dependencies and apply them where necessary.

5. **Access Control**: Only allow authorized users to manage or access your home devices. Consider implementing **role-based access control** (RBAC) and **two-factor authentication** (2FA) for critical systems.

6. **Cloud Services Security**: If you are using cloud services like **Heroku** or **Cloudinary**:

   - Ensure that your API keys and credentials are not exposed in the source code.
   - Use environment variables to store sensitive information, such as SECRET_KEY, database credentials, and any third-party API tokens.

7. **Public Deployment**: If you deploy this project on a public platform (e.g., Heroku), be cautious about exposing it to the internet. Misconfiguration could lead to unauthorized access. Always follow best practices for securing a web application, including **securing the admin interface**, **disabling unnecessary features in production**, and **monitoring logs for suspicious activity**.

## Security Best Practices for Smart Home Devices

When integrating IoT devices such as the ESP32, follow these additional guidelines to secure your smart home system:

1. **Device Isolation**: Consider setting up a separate network or VLAN for IoT devices. This ensures that even if a device is compromised, the attacker won't have access to the rest of your network.
2. **Update Firmware Regularly**: IoT devices often have vulnerabilities that are patched through firmware updates. Regularly update the firmware of the ESP32 and any other connected devices to mitigate known security risks.

3. **Secure Communication**: Use **HTTPS** and **WebSocket Secure (WSS)** protocols for secure communication between the Django server and ESP32 devices. This will ensure that data is transmitted securely over the network, preventing unauthorized interception.

4. **Disable Unused Services**: Disable any services or ports on the ESP32 that are not in use. Reducing the number of open ports decreases the attack surface.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring tools on your Django server to track access attempts and potential security breaches. Configure notifications for suspicious activity or failed login attempts.
